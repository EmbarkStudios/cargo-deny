//!
//! One of the key selling points of Rust is the ever growing and improving ecosystem of crates
//! available that can be easily added to your project incredibly easily via `cargo`. This is great!
//! However, the larger the project is and the more dependencies you have, the harder it is to keep
//! track of certain things, especially as a project evolves over time, which is what `cargo-deny` tries to help
//! you with.
//!
//! * [Licenses](#licenses) - Configure which licenses are allowed
//! * [Bans](#crate-bans) - Configure whether certain crates are allowed to be in your dependency graph
//!
//! ## tl;dr
//!
//! * `cargo-deny check <license|all>` - verify licenses for a crate graph
//! * `cargo-deny check <ban|all>` - verify crate graph doesn't contain certain crates
//! * `cargo-deny list` - list all of the licenses in a crate graph
//!
//! ## Licenses - `cargo-deny check license`
//!
//! One important aspect that one must always keep in mind when using code from other people is what the licensing
//! of that code is and whether it fits the requirements of your project. Luckily, most of the crates in the Rust
//! ecosystem tend to follow the example set forth by Rust itself, namely dual-license `MIT OR Apache-2.0`, but of
//! course, that is not always the case.
//!
//! So `cargo-deny` allows you to ensure that all of your dependencies meet the requirements you want.
//!
//! 1. What happens when a crate is unlicensed? `allow` / `deny` / `warn`
//! 1. What happens when a crate's license can't be determined? `allow` / `deny` / `warn`
//! 1. Explicitly allow or deny 1 or more licenses.
//! 1. Skip checking certain crates as long as they still have the same license information.
//! 1. Ignore specific `LICENSE*` files. `cargo-deny` uses the [askalono](https://github.com/amzn/askalono) crate
//! to parse and score license text as being a certain license, but some license text can be modified to such
//! an extent that it makes it difficult to automatically determine it.
//!
//! ### Example config
//!
//! ```toml
//! [licenses]
//! # If a crate doesn't have a license, error
//! unlicensed = "deny"
//! # If a crate has a LICENSE* file, but it can't be determined, error
//! unknown = "deny"
//! # We want really high confidence when inferring licenses from text
//! confidence_threshold = 0.92
//! # The only licenses we allow. These must be valid SPDX identifiers, at least syntactically,
//! # but nothing stops you from using your own license identifier for your private crates
//! allow = [
//!     "Embark-Proprietary",
//!     "Apache-2.0",
//!     "BSD-2-Clause",
//!     "BSD-2-Clause-FreeBSD",
//!     "BSD-3-Clause",
//!     "BSL-1.0",
//!     "CC0-1.0",
//!     "FTL",
//!     "ISC",
//!     "LLVM-exception",
//!     "MIT",
//!     "MPL-2.0",
//!     "Unicode-DFS-2016",
//!     "Unlicense",
//!     "Zlib",
//! ]
//! skip = [
//!     # ring has a rather complicated LICENSE file due to reasons spelled out
//!     # in said LICENSE file, but is basically OpenSSL for older parts, and ISC
//!     # for newer parts
//!     { name = "ring", licenses = [] },
//!     # webpki uses an ISC license but it only has a 0.83 confidence level
//!     { name = "webpki", licenses = [] },
//! ]
//!
//! [[licenses.ignore]]
//! name = "rustls"
//! license_files = [
//!     # This is a top-level LICENSE that just spells out the *actual* 3
//!     # licenses that can be used with the crate, which askalono is unable
//!     # to score
//!     { path = "LICENSE", hash = 0xe567c411 },
//! ]
//! ```
//!
//! ## Crate bans - `cargo-deny check ban`
//!
//! ### Use Case - Keeping certain crates out of your dependency graph
//!
//! Sometimes, certain crates just don't fit in your project, so you have to remove them. However,
//! nothing really stops them from sneaking back in due to small changes, like updating a crate to
//! a new version that happens to add it as a dependency, or an existing dependency just changing
//! what crates are included in the default feature set.
//!
//! For example, we previously depended on OpenSSL as it is the "default" for many crates that deal
//! with HTTP traffic. This was extremely annoying as it required us to have OpenSSL development libraries
//! installed on Windows, for both individuals and CI. We moved all of our dependencies to use the
//! much more streamlined `native-tls` and `ring` crates instead, and now we can make sure that OpenSSL
//! doesn't return from the grave by being pulled in as a default feature of some future HTTP crate
//! we might use.
//!
//! 1. Dis/allow certain crates in your dependency graph.
//!
//! ### Use Case - Get a handle on duplicate versions
//!
//! One thing that is part of the tradeoff of being able to use so many crates, is that they all won't
//! necessarily agree on what versions of a dependency they want to use, and cargo and rust will happily
//! chug along compiling all of them.  This is great when just trying out a new dependency as quickly as
//! possible, but it does come with some long term costs. Crate fetch times (and disk space) are increased,
//! but in particular, **compile times**, and ultimately your binary sizes, also increase. If you are made aware
//! that you depend on multiple versions of the same crate, you at least have an opportunity to decide
//! how you want to handle them.
//!
//! 1. What happens when multiple versions of a crate are used? `allow` / `deny` / `warn`
//! 1. Skip certain versions of crates, sometimes you just need to wait for a crate
//! to get a new release, or sometimes a little duplication is ok and not worth the effort
//! to "fix", but you are at least aware of it and explicitly allowing it, rather than suffering in
//! ignorance.
//! 1. The `-g <path>` cmd line option on the `check` subcommand instructs `cargo-deny` to create
//! a [dotgraph](https://www.graphviz.org/) if multiple versions of a crate are detected and that
//! isn't allowed. A single graph will be created for each crate, with each version as a terminating
//! node in the graph with the full graph of crates that reference each version to more easily
//! show you why a particular version is included. It also highlights the lowest version's path
//! in ![red](https://placehold.it/15/ff0000/000000?text=+), and, if it differs from the lowest version,
//! the "simplest" path is highlighted in ![blue](https://placehold.it/15/0000FF/000000?text=+).
//!
//! ![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/xtarzeU.png)
//!
//! ### Example Config
//!
//! ```toml
//! [bans]
//! # Emit an error if we detect multiple versions of the same crate
//! multiple_versions = "deny"
//! deny = [
//!     # OpenSSL = Just Say No.
//!     { name = "openssl" },
//! ]
//! skip = [
//!     # The issue where mime_guess is using a really old version of
//!     # unicase has been fixed, it just needs to be released
//!     # https://github.com/sfackler/rust-phf/issues/143
//!     { name = "unicase", version = "=1.4.2" },
//!     # rayon/rayon-core use very old versions of crossbeam crates,
//!     # so skip them for now until rayon updates them
//!     { name = "crossbeam-deque", version = "=0.2.0" },
//!     { name = "crossbeam-epoch", version = "=0.3.1" },
//!     { name = "crossbeam-utils", version = "=0.2.2" },
//!     # tokio-reactor, wasmer, and winit all use an older version
//!     # of parking_lot
//!     { name = "parking_lot", version = "=0.7.1" },
//!     { name = "parking_lot_core", version = "=0.4.0" },
//!     { name = "lock_api", version = "=0.1.5" },
//!     # rand_core depends on a newever version of itself...
//!     { name = "rand_core", version = "=0.3.1" },
//!     # lots of transitive dependencies use the pre-1.0 version
//!     # of scopeguard
//!     { name = "scopeguard", version = "=0.3.3" },
//!     # tons of transitive dependencies use this older winapi version
//!     { name = "winapi", version = "=0.2.8" },
//! ]
//! ```
//!
//! ## CI Usage
//!
//! `cargo-deny` is primarily meant to be used in your CI so it can do automatic verification for all
//! your changes, for an example of this, you can look at the [self check](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny/blob/master/.travis.yml#L77-L87) job for this repository, which just checks `cargo-deny` itself using
//! the [deny.toml](deny.toml) config.
//!
//! ## List - `cargo-deny list`
//!
//! Similarly to [cargo-license](https://github.com/onur/cargo-license), print out the licenses and crates
//! that use them.
