check 0.0.0
Checks a project's crate graph

USAGE:
    check [OPTIONS] [WHICH]...

ARGS:
    <WHICH>...
            The check(s) to perform
            
            [possible values: advisories, ban, bans, license, licenses, sources,
            all]

OPTIONS:
        --audit-compatible-output
            To ease transition from cargo-audit to cargo-deny, this flag will
            tell cargo-deny to output the exact same output as cargo-audit
            would, to `stdout` instead of `stderr`, just as with cargo-audit.
            
            Note that this flag only applies when the output format is JSON, and
            note that since cargo-deny supports multiple advisory databases,
            instead of a single JSON object, there will be 1 for each unique
            advisory database.

    -c, --config <CONFIG>
            Path to the config to use
            
            Defaults to <cwd>/deny.toml if not specified

    -d, --disable-fetch
            Disable fetching of the advisory database
            
            When running the `advisories` check, the configured advisory
            database will be fetched and opened. If this flag is passed, the
            database won't be fetched, but an error will occur if it doesn't
            already exist locally.

    -g, --graph <GRAPH>
            Path to graph_output root directory
            
            If set, a dotviz graph will be created for whenever multiple
            versions of the same crate are detected.
            
            Each file will be created at <dir>/graph_output/<crate_name>.dot.
            <dir>/graph_output/* is deleted and recreated each run.

    -h, --help
            Print help information

        --hide-inclusion-graph
            Hides the inclusion graph when printing out info for a crate

    -s, --show-stats
            Show stats for all the checks, regardless of the log-level

    -V, --version
            Print version information
