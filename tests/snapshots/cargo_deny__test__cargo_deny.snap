Cargo plugin to help you manage large dependency graphs

Usage: cargo_deny [OPTIONS] <COMMAND>

Commands:
  check
          Checks a project's crate graph
  fetch
          Fetches remote data
  init
          Creates a cargo-deny config from a template
  list
          Outputs a listing of all licenses and the crates that use them
  help
          Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Options:
  -L, --log-level <LOG_LEVEL>
          The log level for messages
          
          Only log messages at or above the level will be emitted.
          
          Possible values:
          * off
          * error
          * warn
          * info
          * debug
          * trace
          
          
          [default: warn]

  -f, --format <FORMAT>
          Specify the format of cargo-deny's output
          
          [default: human]
          [possible values: human, json]

  -c, --color <COLOR>
          [env: CARGO_TERM_COLOR]
          [default: auto]
          [possible values: auto, always, never]

      --manifest-path <MANIFEST_PATH>
          The path of a Cargo.toml to use as the context for the operation.
          
          By default, the Cargo.toml in the current working directory is used.

      --workspace
          If passed, all workspace packages are used as roots for the crate graph.
          
          Automatically assumed if the manifest path points to a virtual manifest.
          
          Normally, if you specify a manifest path that is a member of a workspace, that crate will be the sole root of the crate graph, meaning only other workspace members that are dependencies of that workspace crate will be included in the graph. This overrides that behavior to include all workspace members.

      --exclude <EXCLUDE>
          One or more crates to exclude from the crate graph that is used.
          
          NOTE: Unlike cargo, this does not have to be used with the `--workspace` flag.

  -t, --target <TARGET>
          One or more platforms to filter crates by
          
          If a dependency is target specific, it will be ignored if it does not match 1 or more of the specified targets. This option overrides the top-level `targets = []` configuration value.

      --all-features
          Activate all available features

      --no-default-features
          Do not activate the `default` feature

      --features <FEATURES>
          Space or comma separated list of features to activate

      --frozen
          Require Cargo.lock and cache are up to date

      --locked
          Require Cargo.lock is up to date

      --offline
          Run without accessing the network. If used with the `check` subcommand, this also disables advisory database fetching

  -h, --help
          Print help information (use `-h` for a summary)

  -V, --version
          Print version information
