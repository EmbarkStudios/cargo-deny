# Security policy

Protecting your privacy and our products is paramount to establishing trust with our players and users. Therefore, we consistently tweak and enhance our ways of working with security, and aim to be as transparent as possible about this effort.

We truly appreciate efforts to discover and disclose security issues responsibly.

This repository is part of our [Security Bug Bounty Program](https://www.intigriti.com/programs) (hosted by Intigriti) and has GitHub's [Private vulnerability reporting](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability) enabled where you directly can submit vulnerability reports to us privately and securely, as well as optionally create private fork to help fix the issue.

If youâ€™d like to report a security issue found in any of our other products or have security concerns regarding Embark Studios, please reach out to security@embark-studios.com.
