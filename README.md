## [Quickstart](https://embarkstudios.github.io/cargo-deny/)

```bash
cargo install cargo-deny && cargo deny init && cargo deny check
```

## Usage

### [Install](https://embarkstudios.github.io/cargo-deny/cli/index.html) cargo-deny

If you want to use `cargo-deny` without having `cargo` installed,
build `cargo-deny` with the `standalone1 feature.
This can be useful in Docker Images.

```bash
cargo install cargo-deny

# Or, if you're an Arch user
yay -S cargo-deny
```

### [Initialize](https://embarkstudios.github.io/cargo-deny/cli/init.html) your project

```bash
cargo deny init
```

### [Check](https://embarkstudios.github.io/cargo-deny/cli/check.html) your crates

```bash
cargo deny check
```

#### [Licenses](https://embarkstudios.github.io/cargo-deny/checks/licenses/index.html)

The licenses check is used to verify that every crate you use has license terms you find acceptable.

```bash
cargo deny check licenses
```

#### [Bans](https://embarkstudios.github.io/cargo-deny/checks/bans/index.html)

The bans check is used to deny (or allow) specific crates, as well as detect and handle multiple versions of the same crate.

```bash
cargo deny check bans
```

#### [Advisories](https://embarkstudios.github.io/cargo-deny/checks/advisories/index.html)

The advisories check is used to detect issues for crates by looking in an advisory database.

```bash
cargo deny check advisories
```

#### [Sources](https://embarkstudios.github.io/cargo-deny/checks/sources/index.html)

```bash
cargo deny check sources
```
