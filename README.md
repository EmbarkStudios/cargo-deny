#### [Licenses](https://embarkstudios.github.io/cargo-deny/checks/licenses/index.html)

The licenses check is used to verify that every crate you use has license terms you find acceptable.

```bash
cargo deny check licenses
```

#### [Bans](https://embarkstudios.github.io/cargo-deny/checks/bans/index.html)

The bans check is used to deny (or allow) specific crates, as well as detect and handle multiple versions of the same crate.

```bash
cargo deny check bans
```

#### [Advisories](https://embarkstudios.github.io/cargo-deny/checks/advisories/index.html)

The advisories check is used to detect issues for crates by looking in an advisory database.

```bash

#### [Sources](https://embarkstudios.github.io/cargo-deny/checks/sources/index.html)

The sources check ensures crates only come from sources you trust.
