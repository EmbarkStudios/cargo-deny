#default = ["vendored-openssl", "vendored-libgit2"]
# Allows the use of a vendored version openssl when compiling libgit, which allows
# us to compile static executables (eg musl) and avoid system dependencies

#vendored-libgit2 = ["cargo?/vendored-libgit2", "git2/vendored-libgit2"]
# Allows embedding cargo as a library so that we can run in minimal (eg container)
# environments that don't need to have cargo/rust installed on them for cargo-deny
# to still function
